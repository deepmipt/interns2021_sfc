NATH, I don't think I am.,React.Rejoinder.Confront.Challenge.Counter
NATH,Do you ?,React.Rejoinder.Support.Track.Confirm
KATH,And you'd have to have that plus or minus.,React.Rejoinder.Confront.Response.Refute
KATH,What.,React.Rejoinder.Support.Challenge.Rebound
NATH,I don't know what I did to get that.,React.Rejoinder.Support.Response.Resolve
NATH, Where did I get that square root.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Enhance
NATH,um ex squared.,Sustain.Continue.Append.Enhance
KATH, Because you brought this over here.,React.Rejoinder.Support.Response.Resolve
KATH, You brought three over here.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Enhance
KATH, divided by three,Sustain.Continue.Append.Enhance
KATH,and then you have ex squared,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Extend
KATH,so if you want to find ex you have the square root of ex squared.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Enhance
NATH, I guess all I can't figure out is what the square root of negative two two thirds is.,React.Rejoinder.Confront.Challenge.Counter
NATH, Would that be.,React.Rejoinder.Support.Track.Clarify
KATH, square root two.,React.Rejoinder.Support.Response.Resolve
NATH, square root two thirds ?,React.Rejoinder.Support.Track.Check
KATH, over three,React.Rejoinder.Support.Response.Repair
KATH,The whole thing would be over.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Elaborate
KATH,Well. No it couldn't be.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Elaborate
KATH,Square root of two thirds,Sustain.Continue.Append.Elaborate
KATH,yeah.,Sustain.Continue.Append.Elaborate

NATH, Do I deserve this.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Elaborate
NATH, I mean how would you like it when you're laying in bed.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Elaborate
NATH, somebody just grabbed your arm started swinging it around.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Elaborate
KATH, I'd probably just slap em.,React.Respond.Support.Reply.Agree
NATH, Ex squared equals one over the square root of that the square root of that ex equals the square root of one.,Open.Initiate.Give.Fact
KATH,She's not even looking at me. She's just looking,Open.Initiate.Give.Fact
KATH,like...,Sustain.Continue.Append.Elaborate
NATH, I know.,React.Respond.Support.Reply.Acknowledge
NATH, That's what I'm talking about.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Elaborate
NATH,So. would that one be square root of one half ?,Open.Initiate.Demand.Closed.Opinion
KATH,Mhm.,React.Respond.Support.Reply.Affirm
NATH, It would ?,React.Rejoinder.Support.Track.Confirm
KATH, Mhm. Yep.,React.Respond.Support.Reply.Affirm

KATH,um you have to like,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Extend
KATH,have it where you do that,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Enhance
KATH,there's no um. fraction under...,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Enhance
KATH, under the in the denominator ?,Sustain.Continue.Monitor
KATH, I mean no fraction under the...,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Elaborate
NATH,Oh yeah.,React.Respond.Support.Reply.Acknowledge
KATH, So then you just multiply the whole thing by the square root of two and you get the square root of two over two.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Enhance
NATH, Even for the top one ?,React.Rejoinder.Support.Track.Clarify
NATH,Even for that one ?,React.Rejoinder.Support.Track.Clarify
KATH,No.,React.Respond.Confront.Reply.Disagree

NATH, Oh.,React.Respond.Support.Register
NATH,All you do is like go two over one.,React.Respond.Support.Develop.Elaborate
KATH, You have the square root of one.,React.Respond.Support.Develop.Extend
NATH, like that right ?,React.Rejoinder.Support.Track.Confirm
KATH,Mm.,React.Respond.Support.Reply.Affirm
KATH,Since you have the square root of two on the bottom to make that square you have to multiply by the square root of two.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Extend
KATH,And then you get two,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Extend
KATH,and you multiply the top by the square root of two,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Extend
KATH, and you get square root of two.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Extend
KATH,What,React.Rejoinder.Support.Track.Clarify
NATH,I wanna rewind it and hear that back again.,React.Rejoinder.Support.Response.Resolve
NATH, Cause I sure didn't catch it the first time .,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Enhance
NATH,You got the two and you take the square root of two.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Elaborate
NATH, and you get the negative two.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Extend
NATH,which you take the square.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Enhance
NATH,and it comes to two.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Extend
KATH, I'm sorry,React.Respond.Support.Engage
NATH, So. let's talk about this slowly,React.Respond.Support.Develop.Extend
NATH, as I write this down as you're saying it.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Enhance

KATH,But put it as the square root of one over the square root of two.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong.Extend
NATH, Oh.,React.Respond.Support.Register
NATH,And then you multiply that by the square root of two over the square root of two.,React.Respond.Support.Develop.Extend
KATH,Right.,React.Respond.Support.Reply.Agree

NATH, square root two.,React.Respond.Support.Develop.Elaborate
KATH,That's what it was.,React.Respond.Support.Reply.Affirm
NATH,Then right here you'd get square root of two over two.,React.Respond.Support.Develop.Enhance
KATH,Mhm.,React.Respond.Support.Reply.Affirm
NATH, See everything was square root two,React.Rejoinder.Confront.Challenge.Rebound
NATH,over two,Sustain.Continue.Append.Enhance

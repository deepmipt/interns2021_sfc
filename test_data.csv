speaker1,and by the time we got to Hardin we had to put like uh three or four quarts in.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong

speaker1,But that shouldn't make any difference.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,He goes the only thing I can think of is that there was an air lock in there.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,And that running the engine out on the open road ,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, Mhm.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,Caused that air lock to come through. flushed it out.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong

speaker1, And you know how the radiator's the pipe's close to other parts of the engine ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,Yeah.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,So what...,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, It was some part in there.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,caused the fire.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1,The engine being too hot and the oil leaking.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,So he knew that the oil was leaking ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1,No,React.Respond.Confront
speaker1, we knew we were losing oil but we didn't know where.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,I just figured it was from that valve cover gasket.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,Just from lifting up the hood and looking at it.,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker2,So what's he gonna do.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1,Well ʔand two of his wires,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, the sparkplug wires ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,Unhunh.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, were fried all the way through.,React.Respond.Support

speaker1, There's enough uh radiator fluid in there.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, Mhm.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, so that it will It's it's enough.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, Mhm.,React.Respond.Support

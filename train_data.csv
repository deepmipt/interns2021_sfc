speaker1, Am I doing that right so far ?,Open.Initiate.Demand
speaker2, Mhm.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, All the way down to that ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,Mhm. I think.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, I don't think I am.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker1,Do you ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,And you'd have to have that plus or minus.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker2,What.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker1,I don't know what I did to get that.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, Where did I get that square root.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,um ex squared.,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker2, Because you brought this over here.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, You brought three over here.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, divided by three,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker2,and then you have ex squared,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,so if you want to find ex you have the square root of ex squared.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1, I guess all I can't figure out is what the square root of negative two two thirds is.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker1, Would that be.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, square root two.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, square root two thirds ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, over three,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,The whole thing would be over.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,Well. No it couldn't be.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,Square root of two thirds,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker2,yeah.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,But then you got the other one Nathan.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,Oh gosh hm.,Open.Attend.
speaker1, Leah. She snoozing on the floor ?,Open.Initiate.Demand
speaker2,Mhm. Not anymore,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, you woke her up.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, She's doing the karate kid,Open.Initiate.Give
speaker2, Nathan.,Sustain.Continue.Monitor
speaker1, She's like leave me alone.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, Do I deserve this.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker1, I mean how would you like it when you're laying in bed.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1, somebody just grabbed your arm started swinging it around.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, I'd probably just slap em.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, Ex squared equals one over the square root of that the square root of that ex equals the square root of one.,Open.Initiate.Give
speaker2,She's not even looking at me. She's just looking,Open.Initiate.Give
speaker2,like...,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker1, I know.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, That's what I'm talking about.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,So. would that one be square root of one half ?,Open.Initiate.Demand
speaker2,Mhm.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, It would ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, Mhm. Yep.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,But do y'all have to do that,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,um you have to like,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,have it where you do that,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,there's no um. fraction under...,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,ʔuh under the in the denominator ?,Sustain.Continue.Monitor
speaker2, I mean no fraction under the...,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,Oh yeah.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, So then you just multiply the whole thing by the square root of two and you get the square root of two over two.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1, Even for the top one ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1,Even for that one ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,No.,React.Respond.Confront
speaker2, I'm talking about for this one.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker1, Oh.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,All you do is like go two over one.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, You have the square root of one.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, like that right ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,Mm.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,Since you have the square root of two on the bottom to make that square you have to multiply by the square root of two.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,And then you get two,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,and you multiply the top by the square root of two,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, and you get square root of two.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,What,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1,I wanna rewind it and hear that back again.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, Cause I sure didn't catch it the first time .,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,You got the two and you take the square root of two.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1, and you get the negative two.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,which you take the square.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,and it comes to two.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, I'm sorry,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, So. let's talk about this slowly,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, as I write this down as you're saying it.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,Alright ?,Sustain.Continue.Monitor
speaker1,This is what we came out with.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,Right ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, It's.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,But put it as the square root of one over the square root of two.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1, Oh.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,And then you multiply that by the square root of two over the square root of two.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,Right.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,Uhis that what all those square root of twos are haha?,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker2, That's what I was.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,That's what I was trying to say.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, Okay,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, I was wondering where all that square root two,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, square root two.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,That's what it was.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,Then right here you'd get square root of two over two.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,Mhm.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, See everything was square root two,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker1,over two,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker1, and two.,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker2, Right,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, but then what about this one.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker1,on this one.,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker1,Let me do this one.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker2,But you have.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker2,you have i square root of three over square root of three.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker2, I mean. square root of two over.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,square root of three,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker2, I can't even say it right.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1, Over,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker1, do I have another down here or just the one i.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, Um no. Just one.,React.Respond.Confront
speaker1,Okay,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,three and square root of three over square root of three and you get,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker2, square root of six.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, Yeah.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,Over three.,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker2, Is that right ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, I doubt it. I really do.,React.Respond.Confront
speaker1,I'm not kidding.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, You can't.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker2, You can't multiply square roots like that,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker2, can you ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, Square root of two times square root of three is square root of six is it ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, Yeah.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,Okay.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,Well then that's fine.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,Then that is right.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1, Isn't that.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1,You can do that.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,Yeah.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,Cause that's the same way you're multiplying there square root of nine,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, and square root of nine equals three.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, Yeah okay.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, Where's the test.,Open.Initiate.Demand
speaker1,There ain't no telling.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,You have it.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, I mean I have it.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, Okay.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,The next one is,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, five ex times ex minus one,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker1, Is that it ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, um.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, equals two times one minus ex.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1,Leah.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,Two times one minus ex ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,Yeah.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,And that's easy,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,you can do that.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,Oh this is easy.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, Ex squared.,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker1, Please say this will factor ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1,Will it ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,Na you do it.,React.Respond.Confront
speaker1,Well,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, I mean that's just wasting time.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, Cause if it's not.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,Yeah.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,It does ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,Mhm.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,One and negative twofifths ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, Mhm.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,And I can always put those back up into the top.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, and and see if they check.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1, Right ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, Let me just try the one ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, Five,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, I got zero equals ʔzero.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, that's right.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, And that's one ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,Yeah.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, Zero equals zero equals one.,React.Respond.Support

speaker2, Ex times.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,Hang on.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,Number eight. Ex times.,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker2,two minus ex.,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker1,Two minus ex.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,is less than or equal to.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,I don't like these.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,three times ex minus four.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,Three times ex minus four ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, Right.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, Alright,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, distribute first right ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, Mhm.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,Two ex minus ex squared three ex minus twelve you get,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, do that side so you get ex,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1, whoa.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, I don't want to do that.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1, Negative ex squared two ex minus two minus ex,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker1, um plus twelve,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker1, Now do you factor this ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1,after you do that ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, Yeah.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, Yeah.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, Oh but first I gotta take out that negative one,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, don't.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker1, I mean that negative.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,Mhm.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,in front of that ex squared so I just I can multiply that whole side by negative one again though ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, Yeah.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, Then you flip that sign over.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, I have to flip that sign over if I do that ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,Mhm.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, See it's little rules like that that I'm not gonna remember.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker1,So if it's. if it's less than or equal to then and there's minus you have to flip the sign.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1, Okay.,Open.Attend.
speaker1,Are you tired ?,Open.Initiate.Demand
speaker2, Not really.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, I mean kind of but.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,I'm gonna go home in just few minutes.,Open.Initiate.Give
speaker2, Why.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, Cause I can work on this at home and let you get some sleep.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, Ouch.,Open.Attend.
speaker1,Okay.,Open.Attend.
speaker1,S so you say ex plus four ? is greater than or equal to zero ?,Open.Initiate.Demand
speaker1, So you say ex is greater than or equal to negative four and ex three.,Open.Initiate.Demand
speaker2, Or.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,Oh,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, is that one of the ones where you have to do or ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, Yeah.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, And if it's less than do you still do or ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,No that's if it's um,React.Respond.Confront
speaker2, in the in the in between ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,those two numbers you know ?,Sustain.Continue.Monitor
speaker2, If there's like like this one don't look.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,But if there's like ex in the middle.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, Well no that's or.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker2, If you have like one number on one side.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,Mm.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, and it says.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1, Yes.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, greater than or equal to ex.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1, like.,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker2, and than that one's less than or equal to...,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker1, like two is less than or equal to ex.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, is less than or equal to.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, which is,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, ʔuh less than or equal to ʔuh.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, less.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, less than or equal to.,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker1,six.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, Right.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, So the final.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, So that's the answer.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,Right ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, Mhm.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,Number nine.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker2, Okay.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, I don't know this one so.,React.Respond.Confront
speaker1, You don't know how to do this one ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1,So we in trouble.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,Well you apparently knew how to do it.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker1, Did I get it right ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,Well you didn't get the whole thing right.,React.Respond.Confront
speaker2,But Well you just missed one part of it.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1, So what's that problem.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,Um absolute value.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, Okay.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,of one half minus ex over three.,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker1, Ex over three,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, oops. Okay.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, is less,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, I mean is greater than or equal to twothirds.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,Just plain old twothirds ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, Mhm.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, How do you get rid of the absolute value things ?,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker1, Don't you.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,ʔI don't.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,You put is less than or equal to twothirds. Or is greater than,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,I mean is greater than or equal to twothirds,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,and then don't you have like or is less than and is less than or equal to negative two thirds ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, What ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1,Can I see what I did.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, Yeah.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,But when you. when you have absolute value when you take the absolute value off and you put negative twothirds on this side too.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, First I'll just get common denominator.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,So I can do that.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, You can't do it when it's in the absolute value.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker2,though.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker1,Well I did right there.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,Is that why I missed it ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,But see if you wanna do that then at first you bring.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker1,So I only did one part of it in other words.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, Mhm.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, Just bring. Just bring twothirds over to the other side.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker2,Negative twothirds over to the other side.,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker1, And make it equal to zero ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, No.,React.Respond.Confront
speaker2, No keep that there,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,But then have.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,Another one over there ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, Yeah,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, have is less than or equal to negative two thirds.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,And that's not absolute value anymore.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1, Well see we've never done it like that.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker2,Let me see.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,If that's how you do it.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,I mean I'm sure you probably can do it that way.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, I don't know if that's how you do it or not.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, Cause I haven't done this in probably about as long as you have.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, Oops. God.,Open.Attend.
speaker1,It's my own fault,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker1, I shouldn't have waited. so long to get math over with. I should've got it over with right out right out of high school.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong

speaker2,Yuck. I guess.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, Yeah,Open.Attend.
speaker1, You can do it that way ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,Mhm.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, Let me see the pencil.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker2, But then I didn't get what she got.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,I guess she.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,Yeah you can put it so.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, square root of that.,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker2,Oh no it's not gonna work that way.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker2,You don't have it in the middle.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, See I put it in the middle ?,Sustain.Continue.Monitor
speaker2,Seven halves is greater than or equal.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, But you can't put it in the middle,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,cause if it's gonna be. Yeah if it's gonna be greater than that then it's not gonna be less than that.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, Well I guess it can.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,God.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, So one way I could do it.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, Well.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,No.,React.Respond.Confront
speaker2, Wait minute now.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker2, See look what she did.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker2, She um flipped that sign over.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, But uh when ʔyou divide by negative two you have to flip all the signs over.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, which you did.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,Yeah cause you got that right it's right here.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1, Oh gosh.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, You know what,Sustain.Continue.Monitor
speaker1, I'm just gonna skip this one.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, No you're not,React.Respond.Confront
speaker2, you're gonna do it.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,Now.,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker1, So I can't start by...,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker2, Unhunh.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, Not finding common denominator.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,You have to bring.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,Well I can do. find one side by doing that can't I ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, Yeah,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,but why don't you just put the other.,Sustain.Continue.Monitor
speaker2,once you have negative twothirds on the other side then you can find common.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,buh buh buh buh common denominator for the whole thing,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker2,and it's gonna be the same denominator.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,Well what's the common denominator of bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker2,I didn't mean that.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker2, I meant once you bring it over there.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,I know what you meant.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,I don't ever remember us doing anything like that though.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,Well add it onto the other side.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,There's like way you always can get rid of those absolute value bars.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,in problems,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1, isn't there ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, Hey.,Sustain.Continue.Monitor
speaker1, Can I use some of this ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, Oh. Yeah.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,ʔuMm. See yeah. Here it's absolute values.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker2,Right here.,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker1,And it's doing it the way that you were doing it ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, I'm trying to find one like that one ,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, See that's the problem,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker1, there's so many different types.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,That I'm sitting here worrying about this one right here and there probably won't even be one like this on the test.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, I know.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,There'll be different one.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,So what do you do.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker2,You find inequality with an absolute value in it which,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, there's one right there.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, Mhm. See ?,Sustain.Continue.Monitor
speaker2,I sure didn't see any in the...,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1, examples.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, Hmm. See ?,Sustain.Continue.Monitor
speaker2,There's no.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,There it is.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker2,See ?,Sustain.Continue.Monitor
speaker2,Here it is.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2,Absolute value of that you brought ʔuh ʔuh brought negative four over to the other side.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,Okay.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,And all that...,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,See that just proves that she puts problems on there that we've never gone over.,React.Rejoinder.Confront
speaker1, I know we've never done one like that.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1, where you do that,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, Can you. Do you wanna do that when it's less than or can you do that when it's greater than too.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, Yeah.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,Either way.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,So if it's pointed this way you just put another one pointing this way over here.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, Right.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, Okay.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, Where'd you get that one.,Open.Initiate.Demand
speaker2, That's big one.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1, You're not kidding.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, That's my thumbnail.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,Now I just get common denominator for the whole thing ?,Open.Initiate.Demand
speaker2, Mhm. Well,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, take out those absolute value things they'll screw you up.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, ʔYeah.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1,And now this'll be six right ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, Is that right ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,Mhm.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,Now what do you do.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, Subtract three. from the middle.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,And. To which side. To both sides. To both sides ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1,Okay.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, Negative.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2, two ex.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, Alright.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, To one,Sustain.Continue.Append
speaker1,then after that you have to take out the negatives.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, Yeah.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, Divide by.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, Well just. Divide by negative two.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,Oh you can't get that by.,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1,ex by itself ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker2,Yeah.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,And when you divide by negative.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2,you have to flip the signs.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, Yeah.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1, Okay.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, And when you do that it's gonna be or.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, Because if you look at it,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, cause you know it can't be greater than sevenhalves and less than negative halve at theone half at the same time.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker2, So it's gonna be either exis less than or equal to negative one half or.,Sustain.Continue.Prolong
speaker1,Okay.,React.Respond.Support
speaker1,Will you pass me some of that tea please.,Open.Initiate.Demand
speaker1, Oh thank you.,React.Respond.Support

speaker2,You gonna study some more tomorrow then right ?,React.Rejoinder.Support
speaker1, Oh definitely.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, Okay.,React.Respond.Support
speaker2, Ex plus four over three ex minus two is less than zero.,Open.Initiate.Give
